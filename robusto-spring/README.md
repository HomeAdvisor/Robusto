# robusto-spring
This is an extension of the Robusto Client API Framework that uses Spring Web Client for remote HTTP method calls.

## Usage
The quickest way to get started is to build client classes that extend SpringRestClient, then call any of the helper restCommand methods to build ApiCommands.
